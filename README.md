# Bookworm-VisualBasic
Version of the library management program Bookworm but in Visual Basic 6.0

# Why?
* Python (original) version was becoming more bloated, convoluted and harder to compile with problematic dependencies.
* Visual Basic has greater compatibility + the program is intended for Windows 11 and beyond
