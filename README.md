# Bookworm Visual Basic 6
Version of the library management program Bookworm but in Visual Basic 6.0

# Principles
* Maximum speed, ease-of-use and efficiency
* Privacy - encrypted databases for users without correct credentials
* Easy installation and portability - no dependencies need to be installed by user
* Overall user convenience and ease of use, yet advanced management for admins and superadmins

# Why?
* Python (original) version was becoming more bloated, convoluted and harder to compile with problematic dependencies.
* Visual Basic has greater compatibility - Bookworm is intended for Windows 11 and beyond
* As I have been using the program's Python version, I have noticed many QoL fixes that I need to implement
