# Bookworm Visual Basic 6
Version of the library management program Bookworm but in Visual Basic 6.0. 
<br><b>Supports from Windows 98 up to Windows 11 (Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 and 4.1+, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11)</b>
<br><i>Note: Windows 98 requires MSVCVB6.dll runtime DLL to function, which is selected in the installer by default</i>

# Principles
* Maximum speed, ease-of-use and efficiency
* Privacy - encrypted databases for users without correct credentials
* Easy installation and portability - no dependencies need to be installed by user
* Overall user convenience and ease of use, yet advanced management for admins and superadmins
* Past, present and future compatibility with Windows

# Why?
* Python (original) version was becoming more bloated, convoluted and harder to compile with problematic dependencies.
* Visual Basic has greater compatibility - it supports from Windows 98 up to Windows 11 (Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 and 4.1, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11)
* As I have been using the program's Python version, I have noticed many QoL fixes that I need to implement
